# Steppe West Yii (basic) Web App

The app is one instance of the Yii (basic template) application with the following endpoints (or `ends`)...

* steppewest.com
* app.steppewest.com
* dev.steppewest.com
* invite.steppewest.com
* links.steppewest.com

Each end is identified by its subdomain, with steppewest.com identified as `home`. Those identifiers are used for all end specific folders, & anywhere else an end identifiers is required. The generic identifier for documentation is `subdomain`.

As a [soft] security enhancement, the yii folder has been given a long random name, `f85e7124-c0dc-4c64-9e91-99036ba56790`.
