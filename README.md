# Steppe West Yii2 (basic) Web App

This is a web application, in Yii2, for a very specific use case of Steppe West. I have given no consideration to how useful it may be to anyone else. If you do find anything here useful, do what you like with it.

The app is one instance of the Yii (basic template) application with the following endpoints (or `ends`)...

* home -  no subdomain
* subdomain app
* subdomain dev
* subdomain invite
* subdomain links

Each end is identified by its subdomain, with steppewest.com identified as `home`. Those identifiers are used for all end specific folders, & anywhere else an end identifiers is required. The generic identifier for documentation is `subdomain`.

As a [soft] security enhancement, the yii folder has been given a long random name, `long-random-name`.
